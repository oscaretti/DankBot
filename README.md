This is a Discord bot used to play a dumb game I came up with. The premise of it, is to "guess" when the bot becomes "open"
 to the dank command. Because once one person uses said command when the bot is open, bot goes into a cooldown period
 for a semi-random amount of time. To prevent people from just spamming the bot users are also put on a cooldown when
 they attempt to use the dank command when the bot is on cooldown\

Replace manage_roles, token and prefix with appropriate values in main.py(open with any text editor, for example notepad)\
Example:\
`manage_roles = {"457241869680902157", "856241265640922145"}` # List of role id's that are allowed to manage the bot\
`token = "ZYxNTIzNDzujMwMzMJDgXiI6cUHk_6hRCc2.4NTM1gtNQ3L9MJkbNDg.pBc"` # Your bot token goes here\
`prefix = "%"` # Your preferred command prefix
